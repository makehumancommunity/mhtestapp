# MakeHuman GL test application

This is intended to be a user-friendly way to test if the new GL approach works on client machines. Once you have
started the application, you will find a button for showing instructions.

# How to run

To run from source you need the following:

* PyOpenGL
* PyQt5 (at least 5.10)
* NumPy (at least 1.13.0)

These are the same requirements as for MakeHuman 1.2.x.
